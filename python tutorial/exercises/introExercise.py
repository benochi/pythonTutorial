#make another file to store your data objects, I use storeItems.py  

#import the module you made AND rename it


#assign the data objects that you built (Set, List, Tuple, Dict) from your module


#print one of the unpacked variables from your module


#add user input asking for a first and last name


#use the split method to cut the string into first and last name

#capitalize the first letter in each name 


#return a string and concatonate using the + operator to say "Your first name is <firstName> and your last name is <lastName>" 
#using the users inputed names in place of the placeholders in my example. 


#add user input in the CLI(command line interface) and assign it to a variable
#ask the user if they would like a free/cheap/moderate/expensive item.


#build a if/elif/else to handle user input and check the user input string equality with a comparison operator(==)
#if user input does NOT equal the options given, pass

  #print an item from the tuple by index


  #print the set, remember how indexing and slicing don't work in sets like other objects. 
  
  #print an item from the list by index
 
  #Extra credit - check the dict item to see if it returns a True or False boolean value and modify output accordingly. 
  #In the case of my example, it would be checking if the item is 'inStock' 
  #If you want practice you can play around with the 'and' operator, but for my example a nested if(): makes more sense. 

    #print an item from the dict by index and return the name value by using the key 'name'
    

#make a list of imaginary clients and


#build a method that loops over that list, printing each of them.


#execute that method Be sure to pass in any necessary arguments.
#The proper scope should have the list outside of the method. 


#write a lambda method that multiplies an arg by .07%


#assign the price of an item in your dict to a variable

#use the lambda function to find the tax of the item price. 


#add the tax and the original price for the total price and print that total
#Extra credit - Use format to make sure only 2 decimals are returned

#Note - think about using ceil / floor to round change if needed. Remember to import Math if you try this.

#build a while loop that pops customers from the list, prints the customer and stops when the list is empty. 
#be careful to make it stop if there are no customers and Ctrl+C is your friend. 


#build a customer class
#give customers an __init__ a name and an age.

#make a customer


#print the customers name and age


#add a customer method to your class that says "My name is " and uses their name.
#do this in the base class and call that function here. 


#modify the customer age and print it


#now make a child class that inherits from the Customer class
#Remember you can pass to give it the same attributes only. 


#use the child to create an object instance

#use the parents function on the child



#make an iterator for the tuple, in my example it is 'free'
#Lists, Tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable in this fashion


#print a few values using the iterator and keyword next


#practice scope 
#Make a method that has a global variable inside of it and assigns a value to that variable


#call the method


#print the global variable outside of the method


#import the regex module at the top it is called 're'
#make a variable with a string value



#use regex to search for matching words in the string

#print the results, if you are getting "None", check your work.


#build a try/except/finally block and have it return an error
#this is the last thing our application does, so feel free to play around with it.
